Breast cancer is a critical public health concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are pivotal for successful treatment outcomes. In this study, I leverage the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to develop a predictive model for distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors using logistic regression and Support Vector Machines(SVM).

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. An FNA is a medical procedure used to collect cell samples from a breast mass or other tissue using a thin, hollow needle. It's often performed for diagnostic purposes to examine the cells under a microscope. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The model learns to predict the time to recur (recurrence time) from previous patients and then predicts outcome for the new patient.
